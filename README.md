A simple, browser-based tool to help migrate your `tailwind.config.js` (or .ts) file from v3 syntax to the new CSS-native v4 syntax.

## What It Does ðŸ¤”

This tool takes a standard Tailwind CSS v3 configuration object and automatically converts theme extensions and plugins into the new v4 format, which uses CSS rules like `@theme`, `@keyframes`, and `@utility`.

### **Features** âœ¨

* **Theme Conversion**: Converts `theme.extend` properties like `colors`, `screens`, and `fontFamily` into a `@theme` block.
* **Keyframe Conversion**: Translates `keyframes` objects into native CSS `@keyframes` rules.
* **Animation Conversion**: Converts `animation` utilities into basic `@utility` classes.
* **Plugin Imports**: Detects official `@tailwindcss` plugins and converts them to `@import` statements.
* **Dummy Friendly**: Made by me for people like me.
